A couple of home assignments done by me during my Bachelor degree days at MSU (Department of Physics).

The code presented here solves two problems: a harmonic oscillator LDE and a heat PDE.

Notebooks are uploaded here mainly for legacy purposes, but may be useful if you are taking a similar course. The code in the notebooks is pretty much self-explainatory.
